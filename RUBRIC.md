# Overview
In this third practical application assignment, your goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) you encountered in this section of the program. You will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

# Data
The dataset you will use comes from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository Links to an external site.. The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Please see the following link to access the assignment:

# Deliverables
After understanding, preparing, and modeling your data, build a Jupyter Notebook that includes a clear statement demonstrating your understanding of the business problem, a correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics, your findings (including actionable insights), and next steps and recommendations.
