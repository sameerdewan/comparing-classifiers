PROBLEM 10: Model Comparisons
=====================================

MODELS COMPARED:
- Logistic Regression (max_iter=1000)
- KNN (n_neighbors=5, default)
- Decision Tree (no max_depth, default)
- SVM (RBF kernel, default)

BASELINE REFERENCE: 0.8874

DATA-DERIVED OBSERVATIONS:
- Best test accuracy: SVM (0.9037)
- Worst test accuracy: Decision Tree (0.8412)
- Fastest: KNN (0.0034s)
- Slowest: SVM (19.1184s)
- OVERFITTING: Decision Tree has 15.4% train-test gap
