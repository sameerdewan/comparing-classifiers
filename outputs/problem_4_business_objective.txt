PROBLEM 4: Understanding the Task - Business Objective
=====================================

TARGET VARIABLE: 'y'
- Values: ['no', 'yes']
- This represents: whether client subscribed to term deposit

TARGET DISTRIBUTION:
y
no     36548
yes     4640

y
no     88.73
yes    11.27

CLASS ANALYSIS:
- Majority class: 'no' (88.73%)
- Minority class: 'yes' (11.27%)
- Imbalance ratio: 7.9:1

DATA-DERIVED OBSERVATIONS:
- SEVERE imbalance detected: 7.9:1 ratio
- Accuracy will be misleading - a model predicting all 'no' gets 88.7% accuracy
- Must use metrics like F1, precision, recall for minority class

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (y='yes')
based on client demographics, campaign data, and economic indicators.

METRIC RECOMMENDATION (based on 7.9:1 imbalance):
F1-score or ROC-AUC (accuracy misleading due to imbalance)
