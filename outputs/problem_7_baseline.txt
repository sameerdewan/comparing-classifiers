PROBLEM 7: A Baseline Model
=====================================

BASELINE MODEL: DummyClassifier(strategy='most_frequent')

BASELINE PERFORMANCE:
- Training Accuracy: 0.8873
- Test Accuracy: 0.8874

WHAT BASELINE DOES:
- Predicts: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (always 0)
- This equals always predicting 'no'

DATA-DERIVED OBSERVATIONS:
- Baseline always predicts 'no' (majority class)
- This achieves 88.74% accuracy by doing nothing useful
- WARNING: Baseline >80% means accuracy is NOT a good metric
- A model with 90% accuracy is only 1.3% better than guessing

IMBALANCE CONTEXT:
- Class ratio: 7.9:1
- Majority class %: 88.74%

METRIC RECOMMENDATION: F1-score
- Any useful model must beat 88.74% baseline
- Better metrics for this data: F1, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC
